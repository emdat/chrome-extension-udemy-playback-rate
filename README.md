# Udemy Video Playback Rate Additional Speed Options

## Currently does not fully support fullscreen (speed will be reset when loading next video). Fixes on the way.
This extension ([link to extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udemy-video-playback-spee/jipobffkabkgddgmdmmgjoaopbnjnffn?hl=en-US&gl=US)) adds additional playback speed options for videos on Udemy.
You can watch videos at up to 3.5x speed!
